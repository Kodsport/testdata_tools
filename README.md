# Testdata Tools

`gen.sh` contains bash helper functions for working with problems for the
Kattis format, particularly ones that use multiple test groups.

See `generator_example.sh` or `generator_example_acm.sh` for example usage,
and `examples/` for complete example problems.

There used to be CMS support. If you need that, look at the repo history.

`gen.sh` (or the whole repo, whatever is most convenient) is intended to be
copied into your contest's repo and committed. `gen.sh` may be changed freely
if needed.
